# Introduction

## Classical Test Theory

In the social sciences, we are often interested in somewhat 'abstract' concepts or characteristics (e.g., emotions, attitudes, literacy, personality,...). These concept cannot be measured *directly*, but have to be assessed *indirectly* using observable indicators (e.g., items in a questionnaire). Usually, we hence build several items that are meant capture the underlying disposition. 

Test theory explains the relationships between latent variable (e.g., a personality trait such as "extraversion") and the responses to several items (e.g., "I make friends easily.", "I know how to captivate people."). It defines the statistical relations between a measurement and the actual characteristic of interest. 

## Assumptions

In classical test theory, we differentiate the following concepts: 

<br>

_Table 1: Important concepts in classical test theory_

| Name  |  Definition |
|---|--------|
| Latent variables | Not directly observable concepts (later also called 'factors') that we are interested in measuring, such as e.g., emotions, attitudes, personality, literacy, concerns,... |
| Manifest variables/indicators | Measurable indicators such as e.g., items in a questionnaire (but we can also think of other indicators) |
| True score | The share of the measurement variance that is directly linked to the latent variable, hence what we want to estimate to the best of our abilities |
| Measurement error | Share of the measurement variance that is not linked to the latent variable |

<br>

In measuring latent variables, we decompose the variance of each measurement: Every observable measurement $Y$ is composed of variance (true score: $\tau_a$) explained by the latent variable, variance (again a type of true score: $\tau_b$) explained by the specific indicator (e.g., the item), and the measurement error $\epsilon$:

$Y_i = \tau_{a,i} + \tau_{b,i} + \epsilon_i$

The measurement error is thereby independent of the true score and vary randomly across persons and measurement occasions: 

$Cor(\tau_i, \epsilon_i) = 0$


## Reflective measurement model

Factor models, in which a latent characteristics is measured using multiple manifest indicators, can hence be represented with the following path model (panel 1):

<br>

We hence need to specify a latent variable ($\eta$) that explains people's responses in several items ($x_i$) by taking the items-specific error ($epsilon_i$; composed of item-specific variance and error) into account. Of course, not all items will be explained by the latent factor in the same way. Some will be worse and other will be better. This is denote by the factor loading ($\lambda_i$).

Note: There are also formative concepts in which the combination of individual indicators make up the formative factor (e.g., the value of a car is determined by its age, condition, size, make, etc.)


In this tutorial, we will run through an example of how can assess a reflective measurement model using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in R. As we will engage in some data wrangling, we will load the package collection `tidyverse`. Because we will also assess items individually, we also load the package `psych`, which provides nice tools to assess psychometric properties of variables. 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(psych)
```

# Preparation

## Getting some data

For this tutorial, we will assess a classic reflective measurement model of psychology: The Big Five Personality Model as assessed in the International Personality Item Pool (ipip.ori.org). Conveniently, it is included in the `psych` package and we can load it by simply calling `bfi`. Let's quickly open the respective help page to assess the item formulations. 

```{r}
d <- bfi %>% as_tibble
head(d)
?bfi
```


As we can see, the scale consists of 25 items. Based on the Big Five Model of Personality, we can assume that these items reflect five distinct dimensions:

- Agreeableness (e.g., "I inquire about others' well-being")
- Conscientiousness (e.g., "I continue until everything is perfect")
- Extraversion (e.g., "I don't talk a lot.")
- Neuroticism (e.g., "I get irritated easily.")
- Openness (e.g., "I am full of ideas.")

All items are measure on 6-point scale from 1 = Very Inaccurate to 6 = Very Accurate. 

If we look at the item formulations, we can see that 8 items are reverse coded. We should hence inverse them before continuing with out analyses. We can use a simply `mutate()` command to do this quickly. 

## Recoding

```{r}
bfi_items <- d %>%
  select(A1:O5) %>%
  mutate(A1 = (A1-7)*-1,  # recoding (inversed)
         C4 = (C4-7)*-1,
         C5 = (C5-7)*-1,
         E1 = (E1-7)*-1,
         E2 = (E2-7)*-1,
         O1 = (O1-7)*-1,
         O3 = (O3-7)*-1,
         O4 = (O4-7)*-1)
```


## Psychometric Properties

A first step in any confirmatory factor analyses should consist of assessing all items' psychometric properties and whether they are normally distributed. The former, we can do by using the `describe()` function from the `psych` package. This function will provide the mean, standard deviation, min and max as well as estimates for the skewness and kurtosis. 

```{r}
# Descriptive Analysis
bfi_items %>%
  describe
```

Based on the columns skewness and kurtosis, all items seems to be reasonably normally distributed. But let's check this also visually. We 

```{r}
# Checking normal distributions
bfi_items %>%
  pivot_longer(A1:O5, names_to = "key", values_to = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 6, 
                 fill = "lightblue",
                 color = "white") +
  facet_wrap(~key) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Values (1 = Do not agree at all; 6 = Fully agree)",
       y = "Number of responses")
```

We can see that most values are rather normally distributed, but e.g., item A4 or O4 are heavily skewed. This may not be a problem, but this information might be useful later, if we try to improve the model. 

## Multivariate normal distribution check

For any confirmatory factor analyses, we should additionally check whether the assumption of multivariate normal distribution is met. We can do so with the the function `mardia()` from the `psych` package which computes Mardia's test of multivariate skewness and kurtosis. 

```{r}
bfi_items %>%
  mardia(plot = FALSE) # USe MLR instead of ML
```

Both test are significant, suggesting that this assumption is violated. Again, this is not problematic per se, but we should use a robust estimator when fitting the confirmatory model. 

# Confirmatory factor analysis

## Estimating the model

Now we can estimate the assumed model (i.e., assuming the five dimensions). For this, we will use the package `lavaan`, which provides a convenient syntax for fitting structure equation models in general (measurement models are technically structural equation models!). 

The lavaan syntax is straightforward. First, we define each latent factor in one string. In this example, the model syntax only contains three ‘latent variable definitions’. Each formula has the following format:

`latent variable =~ indicator1 + indicator2 + ... + indicator_n`

We call these expressions latent variable definitions because they define how the latent variables are ‘manifested by’ a set of observed (or manifest) variables, often called ‘indicators’. Note that the special `=~` operator in the middle consists of a sign (`=`) character and a tilde (`~`) character next to each other. 

The reason why this model syntax is so short, is that behind the scenes, the `cfa()` function, which wraps around this model in the next step, will take care of several things. First, by default, the factor loading of the first indicator of a latent variable is fixed to 1, thereby fixing the scale of the latent variable. Second, residual variances are added automatically. And third, all latent variables are correlated by default. 

We can generally choose between different estimators (see this [page](https://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/est.html) for more information on different estimators), but as our Mardia test was significant, we use a robust version of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLR). The first argument is the user-specified model. The second argument is the estimator and the third argument the dataset that contains the observed variables.


```{r}
library(lavaan)

# Defining model
cfa_model <- "
   Agreeableness =~     A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5
   Conscientiousness =~ C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5
   Extraversion =~      E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 + E5
   Neuroticism =~       N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 + N5
   Openness =~          O1 + O2 + O3 + O4 + O5
"

# Estimate the model
fit.cfa <- cfa(cfa_model, 
               estimator = "MLR", 
               data = bfi_items)
```


In a first step, we should assess how well our model fits the data. 

```{r}
fitMeasures(fit.cfa, c("chisq.scaled", "df.scaled", "pvalue.scaled", 
                       "cfi.robust", "tli.robust", "rmsea.robust"))
```


In our example, the model did not fit the data too well as the $\chi^2$ value is comparatively high and significant and CFI and TLI are below common thresholds (e.g., < .95). 

Once the model has been fitted, we can also use the `summary()` function, which provides a nice summary of the fitted model:

```{r}
summary(fit.cfa, fit = T, std = T)
```

The output contains three parts:

- The header: Information about lavaan, the optimization method, the number of free parameters and number of observations used in the analysis (in this case n = 2436)
- The fit section: Includes various fit indices to assess model fit
- Parameter Estimates: The last secion contains all parameters that were fitted (including the factor loadings, variances, thresholds...)

In our example, the factor loadings range from .233 to .825. Thus, some items (those with factor loadings below e.g., < .5) have a comparatively low true score, i.e., the assumed latent dimensions does not explain the responses to this items very well. 

## Investigating possibilites to increase fit

We thus have to conclude that our original model does not fit the data well and that there is still some misfit that may stem from bad items or a faulty assumption about the dimensionality. 

We can use the function `modindices()` to better understand reasons for misfit. We directly arrange the output according to the mi column and round the result to 2 decimals. 

```{r}
# Extracting modifiction indices
modindices(fit.cfa) %>%
  arrange(-mi) %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)
```

The first line shows e.g., that the items N1 and N2 share a lot of common variance and should be subsumed under their own latent factor. The second line further tells us that the item N4 (an item that should measure neuroticism) also laods onto the factor extraversion. It thus has unwanted cross-loadings. Looking at these modification indices as well as the factor loadings AND assessing the items formulations, we may come to the conclusion that we could signicantly improve model fit by removing some items. So we specify a second model where some "bad" items are removed. 

```{r}
# Removing some items
cfa_model2 <- "
   Agreeableness =~          A2 + A3 + A4 + A5
   Conscientiousness =~ C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5
   Extraversion =~      E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 + E5
   Neuroticism =~       N1 +      N3 + N4 + N5
   Openness =~          O1 + O2 + O3 +      O5
"
fit.cfa2 <- cfa(cfa_model2, 
               estimator = "MLR", 
               data = bfi_items)

# Output
summary(fit.cfa2, fit = T, std = T)

# Extracting factor loadings
parameterEstimates(fit.cfa, standardized=TRUE) %>% 
  filter(op == "=~") %>% 
  select(Item=rhs, Standardized=est, ci.lower, ci.upper, SE=se, Z=z, 'p-value'=pvalue)
```

The model fit slightly increased (yet still does not reach satisfactory levels) and all factor loadings are now acceptable. 

Overall, this tells us that the theoretical assumption that this item pools reflects five personality characteristics is somewhat right, but there is still problems in the data. Usually, we would try to further optimize the model or even evaluate a new item pool at this point. For this tutorial, we will now move on to look at the reliability - another aspect that we should look at when evaluating a scale. 


# Reliability

The additive variance decomposition that we used to estimate our latent measurement model is also the basis for one of the most important estimates in classical test theory: the reliability. It can be defined as the true score share of the measured variance: 


$Rel(Y_i)$ = $\frac{Var(\tau_i)}{Var(Y_i)}$ = $\frac{Var(\tau_i)}{Var(\tau_i) + Var(\epsilon_i)}$


If we have a multi-item measure, the covariance between two items of the same scale represents the true score:

$Var(\tau) = Cov(Y_1, Y_2)$

In practice, several different scores have been proposed to estimate a scale's reliability. Perhaps the most common one is Cronbach's $\alpha$, which however assume $\tau$-equivalency (i.e., that all factor loadings are the same), which is mostly not the case! Alternatively, we can have a look at McDonald's $\omega$ which is also known as "composite" reliability. The package `semTools` provides convenient functions that extend the functionality of `lavaan`. We can use the simple function `reliability()` to compute all relevant reliability estimates.


```{r}
semTools::reliability(fit.cfa2)
```

The resulting table includes Cronbach's $\alpha$ (alpha), Bollen's $\omega$ (omega), Bentler's $\omega$ (omega2), and McDonald's $\omega$ (omega3) which is also know as hierarchical omega. If the model is good, all of these scores will not differ much. If the model contains items with low factor loadings, the omega values will differ considerably from the alpha. All of them range from 0 to 1 with values closer to 1 representing good reliability. Although common thresholds (e.g., .7 = acceptable, .8 = good, and .9 = excellent), what can be considered a good reliability really depends on what you are measuring and the consequences of potential measurement error in your model. 

# Why bother?

We have seen that we can use confirmatory factor analyses to assess a scales' dimensionality, factor validity, and reliability. This is important in its own right as it will tell us how appropriate it is to combine several items into a mean or sum indice. However, there is more to accurately measuring latent variables:

>"Generally, ignoring measurement error leads to inconsistent estimators and to inaccurate assessments of the relation between the underlying latent variables."
>(Bollen, 1989)

There is always measurement error that we should not ignore. Relationships between variables with measurement errors (e.g., mean indices) will always be biased (usually downward). As we are often interested in rather small relationships (e.g., r = .10), we should try to reduce the measurement error. 

For example, instead of correlating mean scores, we can correlated the estimated true scores in a structural equation model. Below, we first compute the mean indices for all dimensions. We then investigate the relationship between Agreeableness and Extraction based on the mean scores as well as based on the structural equation model that we estimated earlier (basically the inter-factor correlation in the CFA model). As one can see, the correlation between the latent variables is higher than the correlation between the mean scores. 


```{r}
# Creating Sum Scores
bfi_items <- bfi_items %>%
  mutate(A_i = (A2 + A3 + A4 + A5)/4,
         C_i = (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5)/5,
         E_i = (E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 + E5)/5,
         O_i = (O1 + O2 + O3 + O5)/4,
         N_i = (N1 + N3 + N4 + N5)/4)

# Correlation between sumscores and between latent variables
tibble(sumscore = cor(bfi_items$A_i, bfi_items$E_i),
       latentvariable = parameterEstimates(fit.cfa2, standardized = T) %>%
         filter(lhs == "Agreeableness", rhs == "Extraversion") %>%
         select(std.nox) %>% as.numeric)

```
