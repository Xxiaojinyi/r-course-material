# Introduction

## Basic idea

## Steps

A moderation analysis typically consists of the following steps.

1. Compute the interaction term $XZ = X * Z$.
2. Fit a multiple regression model with $X$, $Z$, and $XZ$ as predictors.
3. Test whether the regression coefficient for $XZ$ is significant or not.
4. Interpret the moderation effect.
5. Display the moderation effect graphically.
